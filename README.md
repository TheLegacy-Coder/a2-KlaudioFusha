## Workout Calorie Calculator
I was able to come up with a workout calorie calculator application that gives users the ability to input a workout starting and ending time, type, intensity to get an estimate of how many calories they burned. Once the form is submitted, data will be dynamically displayed in a results table at the bottom of the page. In that table, users have the ability to view, edit, and delete workout data. Regarding the CSS position technique, I used flexbox and changed the default direction from row to column. I also used gaps, a Google font (Madimi One), padding, margins, changed the background colors, and defined a max width.

## Technical Achievements
- **Single-Page App**: This allows for the data to be added, deleted, and edited dynamically. This means that the user will not have to refresh the page or visit a different one in order to see their workout data, since it will be displayed live. Updated data is sent to the client from the server upon form submission.
- **Enabling Ability to Edit Existing Data**: This allows for the existing data to be edited by the user. For each table row, there is an 'Edit' button. Upon pressing it, the read-only data in that row will turn into input fields (respective of the input type). Even if they decide to not change anything, the input fields will maintain the previous data and they just press confirm and not changes will be reflected.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Tested UI with Other Students**:
 1. Shiu, Sunku

 3. What comments did they make that surprised you?
 4. What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
